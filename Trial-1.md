## Stock Market & How to Purchase Stocks
### A stock (equity) represents fractional ownership in a company. The stock market is where shares of publicly traded companies are bought and sold.
### Companies sell stocks to raise capital for growth; investors buy stocks to potentially grow their wealth through stock price appreciation or dividends.
### The price of a stock is determined by supply and demand on exchanges like the NYSE and Nasdaq.
### How to Purchase Stocks (The Process):
> ### 1. **Determine Investment Goals & Risk Tolerance:** Decide why you're investing and how much risk you're comfortable with.
> ### 2. **Open a Brokerage Account:** This is a specialized account for buying and selling investments. Many online brokers are beginner-friendly with no minimum deposit.
> ### 3. **Fund Your Account:** Transfer money from your bank to the brokerage account.
> ### 4. **Choose Your Investments:** For beginners, stock funds (ETFs, mutual funds) are often recommended for diversification. Investing in individual stocks is also an option but carries more risk.
> ### 5. **Place Your Order:** Use your broker's platform to buy the chosen investment.
### - **Key Considerations for Beginners:** Diversify your portfolio to spread risk, focus on long-term investing, and don't invest money you might need for emergencies.
## Criteria for Selecting Best Stocks
### - **Fundamental Analysis:** Examine a company's financial health. Look for consistent earnings and revenue growth, review the balance sheet, and check for a history of paying dividends. Key ratios include Price-to-Earnings (P/E) and Debt-to-Equity.
### - **Qualitative Analysis:** Assess factors like a company's competitive advantage (economic moat), the quality and experience of its management team, and the strength of its brand.
### - **Macroeconomic and Industry Analysis:** Invest in growing, stable industries. Consider broader economic trends like inflation, GDP growth, and technological megatrends (AI, decarbonization).
### - **Personal Investment Considerations:** Your stock choices should align with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. For long-term investing, avoid highly speculative stocks.

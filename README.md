# Oversight AI - 3-Step Artificial Intelligence System

**Discerning Eye | Artificial Intelligence tailored for creating comprehensive reports on topics with categorized important and key information.**

## Overview

Oversight AI is a sophisticated 3-step artificial intelligence system designed to analyze topics comprehensively and generate detailed informative reports. The system employs a systematic approach to information processing, categorization, and report generation.

## 3-Step Process

### Step 1: Topic Input
- **Purpose**: Validate and prepare user-provided topics for analysis
- **Process**: Input validation, topic normalization, and preparation for processing
- **Output**: Validated and formatted topic ready for research

### Step 2: Information Processing
#### Step 2a: Compile Information
- **Purpose**: Conduct in-depth research on the provided topic
- **Process**: Multi-angle research approach covering:
  - Definitions and overviews
  - Key concepts and principles
  - Applications and use cases
  - Benefits and advantages

  - Current trends and developments
  - Future outlook and predictions
- **Output**: Comprehensive research data from multiple perspectives

#### Step 2b: Categorize Text
- **Purpose**: Systematically categorize information by importance
- **Process**: Information architect analyzes content using:
  - Keyword-based importance scoring
  - Content angle assessment
  - Length and comprehensiveness evaluation
  - Hybrid scoring algorithm
- **Output**: Categorized information with importance levels:
  - High Priority (Critical Information)
  - Medium Priority (Important Information)
  - Low Priority (Supporting Information)
  - Supplementary (Background Information)

### Step 3: Output Generation
- **Purpose**: Generate comprehensive informative reports
- **Process**: Structured report creation with multiple format options
- **Output**: Professional reports with:
  - Executive summaries
  - Detailed analysis
  - Technical specifications
  - Quick summaries
  - Categorized insights
  - Actionable recommendations

python app.py
```
Access the web interface at: `http://localhost:12001`

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from src.oversight_ai import OversightAI

# Initialize the system
oversight_ai = OversightAI()

# Process a topic
result = oversight_ai.process_topic("Artificial Intelligence", "detailed")

if result['success']:
    print(f"Report generated: {result['session_id']}")
    print(result['text_report'])
else:
    print(f"Error: {result['error']}")
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/analyze` - Analyze a topic
- `GET /api/status/<session_id>` - Get processing status
- `GET /api/results/<session_id>` - Get session results
- `GET /api/download/<session_id>` - Download report
- `GET /api/history` - Get processing history
- `GET /api/statistics` - Get system statistics

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Research Engine (`src/research_engine.py`)
- Conducts multi-angle research on topics
- Generates comprehensive information from various perspectives
- Provides research summaries and metadata

#### 2. Information Architect (`src/information_architect.py`)
- Analyzes content importance using hybrid scoring
- Categorizes information into priority levels
- Provides confidence metrics and reasoning

#### 3. Report Generator (`src/report_generator.py`)
